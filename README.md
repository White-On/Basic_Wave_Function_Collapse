# Basic_Wave_Function_Collapse ðŸŒŠðŸŒŠðŸŒŠ
Implementation of the Wave function collapse in Python. This work is based on this repository : https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse

You have 2 versions of this work :
- the basic WFC where you hard code the tiles and connection between them
- the overlapping pattern version which takes a pattern image, build the tiles and run the WFC

You can tweak the parameter in each version like the size of the tiles, display size, recursive depth, ...

This repo is just me trying stuff out and experimenting, this is not fully optimized and need review if you want to use it
