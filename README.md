# Basic_Wave_Function_Collapse ðŸŒŠðŸŒŠðŸŒŠ
Basic implementation of the Wave function collapse in Python. This work is based on this repository : https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse

To start the program, you just need to execute the Main.py program with python 3 and the tkinter interface will open with 3 elements : **The picture created**, **the reset button** and **the Save button** ( you can save once the picture is done and will end up being named *"ImageResult.png"*. You should be able the change the tiles in the *tiles* file by importing you own and change the *getAllTiles()* function and the tiles configuration in the Main.py. Be careful tho, This implementation has a lot of weakness and require very simple tiles. My version **doesn't have backtracking implemented** and some created image won't succeed to be complete ðŸ˜…. So the program recreate a image from scratch.
